# Tesla Megapacks

Tesla on Twitter announced: ["Meet Megafactory, our new Megapack factory in Lathrop, CA ðŸ”‹ðŸ”‹ðŸ”‹"](https://t.co/aw85eHECXI)

Tesla's energy division has recently completed their new Megapack factory in Lathrop California , which they claim can produce currently 10'000 Megapacks a year. How much storage is that and how does this compare to a Hydropower pump storage plant?

## Tesla megapacks Specs per pack 

- 4 Hour Duration 
- Power: 970 kW 
- Energy: 3,916 kWh per Megapack 
- Round Trip Efficiency: 93.5% 
- 9.12 m x 1.65 m x 2.79 m 
- 38,100 kg
- ~$2 million per pack

## Offer 

An offer was generated on the Tesla Energy website to get an appropriate pricing for the largest system they offer.

- 1000 Megapack 
- 969.6 MW Power 
- 3916 MWh Energy Megapack 
- Duration: 4 Hours 
- Delivery: Q3 2024 
- Estimated Price (California) $1,832,519,850 
- Est. Annual Maintenance $4,821,480 - Maintenance Price escalates at 2% per year

Based on this, we can see that 10'000 megapacks represent about 39160 MWh of storage (39 GWh), with a sales cost of approx $18 billion. 

So how does this compare to the two latest large Swiss Pump-Storage Hydropowerplants?

## Hydropower plants

### Nant-de-Drance pump-storage extension

- 1 Pump-storage power plant
- Power 900 MW (Turbines and Pumps)
- Storage 20 GWh
- Duration: 19 Hours
- Round trip efficiency: over 90%
- Estimated Price 2 billion CHF
- ~14 years to build and bring into operation

### Kraftwerk-Linthâ€“Limmern pump-storage extension

- 1 Pump-storage power plant
- Power 1000 MW (Turbines and Pumps)
- Storage 33 GWh
- Duration: 33 Hours
- Round trip efficiency: over 90%
- Estimated Price 2.1 billion CHF
- ~10 years to build and bring into operation


## Conclusion
The storage cost of the batteries is currently about a factor 4-9x the price of the hydropower plant construction but have the advantage of being available within about 18 months. What remains to be seen is how much battery degradation is a factor in these grid scale battery installations. At least Tesla is offering, from my understanding, a 15 year warranty on the Megapack.

The amount of storage produced by the factory represents more than 1 large hydropower plant per year.

The 39 GWh storage produced by the factory in one year is a huge amount, so much that it would cover around 25% of the [expected total capacity that the IEA planned for the entire world by 2026](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/battery-storage-capability-by-countries-2020-and-2026).

## Post-scriptum: new gridscale batteries in Europe

2022.11.22 - [Cottingham: Europe's biggest battery storage system switched on - 196MWh](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-humber-63707463)

- Power: ? (my estimate ~50-100 MW)
- Storage: 196 MWh  
- use Tesla's AI software to match energy supply to demand
- Commissioning in two stages in December 2022 and March 2023.
- Supplier: Tesla
- Cost: ? (my estimate $100 million+)

Us usual, BBC is terribly uninformative about specifications and cost. If we assume 50 Tesla Megapacks, cost should be around $100 million+ and 50 to 100 MW based on the 2h or 4h megapacks. Interesting to see a Tesla system in Europe. I expect many more to come online.
