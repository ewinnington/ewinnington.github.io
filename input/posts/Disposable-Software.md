# The era of throw away software is upon us

  With the advent of LLMs and their capability to create quick programs ("create me a flashcard app", "I need a typing exercise software", "make a dashboard to track my investments"), we might see a lot more software being written, used and then discarded since it's trivial for a LLM to re-write it next time it is needed. 
  
  Where perfection is not required, just good enough, there will be a whole slew of applications, websites and programs that are used and put into production that are never even reviewed by a human programmer, just tested for their outputs and/or visually checked by a human. Even, we might see lots of code that is only ever read by a machine for bugs and issues, to then be corrected by a machine.
