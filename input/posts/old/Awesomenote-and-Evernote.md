A fantastic feature of Awesomenote is that it synchronizes with both Evernote and Google docs. This means your notes follow you to every platform and device you can imagine or access the net with.

In Evernote, your notes appear without any of the Awesomenote backgrounds, but with a short amount of metadata at the bottom of the note.

Once sync is setup, it is one button press away. Ensuring you are always backed up and accessible.
