Since I haven't talked much about what I've been doing with my Pi, here's the latest:

I've installed a distribution called [ArkOS](https://arkos.io/), which exposes a web interface allowing the easy configuration of many network accessible services, including a blog and an [owncloud](http://owncloud.org/) instance.

I use owncloud as my private, unlimited, Dropbox. The first time I set it up, on a nginx server, it took a lot of configuration to get just right. ArkOS does it all out of the box.

For dynamic DNS, instead of my previous self-hosted "poor man's" link, I am now using [DuckDNS](http://duckdns.org/) which promises free dynamic DNS and is really easy to use.
