To be able to post updates from my phone, I downloaded the [Wordpress app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880) for iPhone. To allow publishing, it was necessary to activate XML-RPC, this setting is found in the Settings - Writing - Remote Publishing section of the Wordpress configuration.

Once this was done, logging in with the Wordpress app worked.
