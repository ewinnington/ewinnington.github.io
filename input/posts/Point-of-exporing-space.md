In my view, the point of exploration is hope. For a small slice of humanity, hope in a better world is what drives us. 

By learning about the composition of the moon, setting up ultra precise reflectors on its surface to map its motion and exploring it, we are learning about our solar system and the universe, as well as the challenges we will face in the centuries to come.

Humanity needs to expand beyond earth to realize how precious earth is. Every person who has been to space has come back profoundly changed and humbled by the experience. A little distance is needed to appreciate the view and realize how lucky we all are.

The science benefits us all: Solar panels and microwaves to medical innovations. Theory of ecology in closed systems, advanced recycling  and so many more. 

Mars and the moon are but a stepping stone to the solar system. And hopefully to the milky way and beyond. We need to answer the question "Is there life out there?", or at least I do.
