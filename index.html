                    </a>
                    <p>Posted on Sunday, 3 November 2019</p>
<h1 id="initial-post">Initial post</h1>
<p>I rewatched this talk from 2014, <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript">The Birth and Death of JavaScript</a>, and am still amazed at how prescient it was and still is.</p>
<p>The blurb for this is:
“This science fiction / comedy / absurdist / completely serious talk traces the history of JavaScript, and programming in general, from 1995 until 2035.”</p>
<p>ASM JS is still there, but what Gary Bernhardt calls Metal in the talk is WebAssembly. And WebAssembly (Wasm) is coming, and not just for the web.</p>
<p>In the .Net world, we see the first glimpses of the power of Wasm with the arrival of <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor">Blazor</a>, which allows the execution of code running on the .net framework (using the mono runtime) inside a browser.</p>
<p>Wasm is not stopping there. With the <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/standardizing-wasi-a-webassembly-system-interface/">standardising of WASI</a>, a system interface to run Wasm outside the web, we are truly moving towards architecture independence.</p>
<p>It might take until 2035, like in the video, for Wasm to take over the world, but I have the feeling we will see its impact in the near future. Looking at the progress on Wasm in the two last years, I would recommend any programmer to read up on it and understanding its implications on the way they work.</p>
<p>For further reading on Wasm, I would recommend the mozilla <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/category/webassembly/">WebAssembly Archives</a> and in particular, the <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/10/webassemblys-post-mvp-future/">WebAssembly post mvp future by Lin Clark</a>.</p>
<h1 id="update-in-november-2019">Update in november 2019</h1>
<p>Over the last few months, I have seen Wasm cropping up in more and more places, for example as a way to deploy code to running inside databases, such as the case of <a href="https://medium.com/wasmer/announcing-the-first-postgres-extension-to-run-webassembly-561af2cfcb1">Wasm for Postgres</a> which allows stored procedures to run webassembly code.</p>
<p>Another case of that is the reflection on using <a href="https://youtu.be/3yVc5t-g-VU">WebAssembly as a glue between programming languages</a> by allowing type information and guarantees to flow between programming languages. This would allow future systems to take the best of breed choice of programming language for each component of the system while still allowing compile time reasoning on type safety by using a type preserving compiler.</p>

<p>As I noted on twitter, as I read, watch and learn about webassembly, I'm getting the feeling this is going to be a titanic shift in the way we reason about programs, languages, frameworks and software design in general.</p>

<p>I had to get some data out of files written by Fortran. The format was a large array of doubles.</p>
<ul>
<li>numeric() for doubles</li>
<li>integer() for integers</li>
</ul>
<p>readBin takes the input file and reads the binary data. If you want to read to the end of the file, don't give a dimension as 3rd parameter.</p>

<p>I needed to access Redis from R. Here's the code I used to connect, set a value, then deserialize a key that was in json format and publish a message. <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rredis/vignettes/rredis.pdf">Rredis documentation located here</a></p>

                        <h2>Using Github actions to build Wyam and publish to github pages</h2>
                    </a>
                    <p>Posted on Sunday, 3 November 2019</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Not that I have Wyam as a static site generator, I want to use <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">Github Actions</a> to automatically deploy it on push. This requires a quite few steps to setup, but I did it, now so can you!</p>
<p>Github actions is still in beta, so you'll have to enroll to use the functionality:
<img src="/posts/images/github-actions-wyam/EnrollActions.png" class="img-fluid" alt="EnrollActions" /></p>
<h1 id="setup-procedure">Setup procedure</h1>
<p>This setup assumes you have a local Wyam that is working on your local machine. You can easily set one up by <a href="http://ewinnington.github.io/posts/Switching-to-wyam">following these steps</a>. You can always have a look at my <a href="https://github.com/ewinnington/ewinnington.github.io">https://github.com/ewinnington/ewinnington.github.io</a> repository to see what I have configured in my config.wyam.</p>
<h2 id="personal-page">Personal page</h2>
<p>First you must have a <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Personal Page</a> setup in github. This is done by creating a public repository <em>username</em>.github.io.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/github-actions-wyam/CreateRepo.png" class="img-fluid" alt="RepoCreation" /></p>
<h3 id="create-the-correct-branches">Create the correct branches</h3>
<p>Inside that repository, you will want to create a second branch next to the master: source. This can be done by typing a new branch name in the Switch branches/tags text box.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/github-actions-wyam/SourceBranch.png" class="img-fluid" alt="SourceBranch" /></p>
<p>Next step is to make this branch the default when we push commits to the repository. This is because the <em>master</em> branch of the username.gitub.io is what is hosted on github's personal pages. Therefore the source of the wyam site has to be stored on another branch. To set the branch as default, Go to <em>Settings</em>, then <em>Branches</em> and select <strong>source</strong> in the dropdown box. Confirm with update.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/github-actions-wyam/SettingsBranches.png" class="img-fluid" alt="SettingsBranches" /></p>
<h3 id="prepare-keys-and-install-them">Prepare keys and install them</h3>
<p>We will be doing automated pushes from the <strong>source</strong> branch to the <strong>master</strong> branch, this means that we need to setup deploy keys and the associated secrets so that github allows us to update in an automated manner.</p>
<p>First, you need to generate your keys locally on your own machine with <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C &quot;Github-user-email&#64;example.com&quot; -f gh-pages -N &quot;&quot;</code>. You will need to replace <em>Github-user-email&#64;example.com</em> with your own, of course.</p>
<p>This will generate two files:</p>
<ul>
<li>gh-pages : the private key file, this will go into the secrets tab on github. I named the key <strong>ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY</strong>, this is important because we need to access it as an environment variable later in the action workflow script.</li>
<li>gh-pages.pub : the public key file, this will go to the deploy tab on github. I named my deploy key <em>public ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once installed, they should be like this in the github user interface of the repository:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/github-actions-wyam/SecretsKey.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Secrets" />
<img src="/posts/images/github-actions-wyam/DeployKey.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Deploy" /></p>
<h2 id="clone-the-repository-or-import-an-existing-git-repo">Clone the repository (or import an existing git repo)</h2>
<p>If you have nothing yet in the repository, I suppose you can now directly clone it from github using <code>git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io</code> and it should come out all pre-prepared for you. Check something in and push.</p>
<h3 id="existing-repository">Existing repository</h3>
<p>I had an existing repository, so I had a few things to do with it before it was ready to be uploaded. I had already a master branch named <strong>master</strong>, so to make it conform with github, I renamed my local master branch with <code>git branch -m source </code>.</p>
<p>I then removed the previous origin before that was in use and I had to add the correct origin that I wanted to push to. Because I had previously had contents on the repository, I had to use the -f command on the push.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git remote remove origin</code></li>
<li><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/username/username.github.io</code></li>
<li><code>git push -u -f origin source</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that I had pushed the Wyam blog, I was ready to setup the actions.</p>
<h4 id="side-note-good-wyam.gitignore-file">Side note - good wyam .gitignore file</h4>
<p>To avoid checking in the output files of the wyam build, I have the following .gitignore file in the repository:</p>
<pre><code>config.wyam.dll
config.wyam.hash
config.wyam.packages.xml
wwwroot
output
</code></pre>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-github-actions">Setting up the github actions</h2>
<p>First you will want to check that you are allowing external workflow scripts to be launched on your repository, since I will be relying on a few steps from pre-existing scripts.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/github-actions-wyam/SetupActions.png" class="img-fluid" alt="SetupActions.png" /></p>
<p>Here the first mistake I made while configuring actions was not going through the Github user interface and instead creating the folders manually in my github repository. I created <em>.github/workflow</em> instead of <strong>.github/workflows</strong> which meant that my actions were never kicking off. So don't make my mistake, use the github UI to set up the action and they will create the correct folder structure in your project.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/github-actions-wyam/SetUpActionsWorkflow.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Actions workflow" /></p>
<p>I setup a yaml file name <a href="https://github.com/ewinnington/ewinnington.github.io/blob/source/.github/workflows/wyam.yml">wyam.yml</a>. You can see what it looks like here below (I have included the code below on the page for you to copy and paste if you want. Let's go through this line by line.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/github-actions-wyam/wyam-yaml.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Wyam Yaml" /></p>
<p>Line 1: Name of the action that will appear in the action tab</p>
<p>Line 3-6: Triggers of the action. Here we trigger the action <strong>on push</strong> of <strong>branch source</strong>.</p>
<p>Line 8: List of jobs to run.
Line 9: First job is my build and deploy, I just called it build.</p>
<p>Line 11: The choice of the image to run on, like in docker. I chose ubuntu-latest.</p>
<p>Line 13: Each line prexifed with a - is a seperate action.</p>
<p>Line 14: Checkout the repository with the branch that has just been pushed. This is a standard github action, you can find <a href="https://github.com/actions/checkout">explanations here</a></p>
<p>Line 15: Installing .net core for Wyam.</p>
<p>Line 19-20: Installing Wyam. Here I install Wyam as a local tool by giving the <code>--tool-path .</code>, since if you install it as a global tool with <em>-g</em>, the build system won't find it due to .net core's requirement <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/8368">to restart the shell after being installed for the paths to be valid</a>.</p>
<p>Line 21-22: Running Wyam to render the blog to a set of static pages. Here is where you can change the template (Phantom) to something else if you want.</p>
<p>Line 23-28: We take the output of Wyam, which lives in the ./output folder and we use <a href="https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages">peaceiris's github action for Github Pages</a> to publish our results to the correct branch <em>master</em> of our repository for deployment. We pass the <em>secrets.ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY</em> we defined earlier to allow the script to publish to the master branch.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">name: Wyam

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - source  # default branch

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout&#64;v1
    - name: Setup .NET Core
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet&#64;v1
      with:
        dotnet-version: 2.1.802
    - name: Install Wyam
      run: dotnet tool install --tool-path . wyam.tool
    - name: Publish blog
      run: ./wyam -r blog -t Phantom
    - name: Deploy
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages&#64;v2.5.0
      env:
        ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY }}
        PUBLISH_BRANCH: master  # deploying branch
        PUBLISH_DIR: ./output

</code></pre>
<h2 id="running-the-workflow">Running the workflow</h2>
<p>Once you have setup this file, you can commit it and it should start off the build action. You can follow the progress of the action workflow on the github action page.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/github-actions-wyam/ActionOverview.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Action Overview" /></p>
<p>You can drill down into the details of the actions in case you had any failures. This is where I had the most trouble, but with these instructions, you should be fine.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/github-actions-wyam/ActionDetail.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Action Detail" /></p>
<h1 id="closing">Closing</h1>
<p>If all went well, you should now have your personal wyam generated site up and running at <a href="http://username.github.io">http://username.github.io</a> .</p>
<p>Please feel free to look around both branches <em>source</em> and <em>master</em> on <a href="https://github.com/ewinnington/ewinnington.github.io">my github repo</a> to understand how my blog is setup.</p>
