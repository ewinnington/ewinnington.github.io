                        <h2>Learning concepts from chatGPT - Operational Transform and Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</h2>
                    </a>
                    <p>Posted on Sunday, 11 December 2022</p>
<p>I have been enjoying using <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">chatGPT</a> as a private tutor / reference on topics. My biggest issue is now keeping up with the knowledge and asking the right questions.</p>
<p>But, remember that chatGPT is not all knowing and can get things wrong - even fabulating, so you have to double check the information. I did my best to validate the information with <a href="https://mwhittaker.github.io/consistency_in_distributed_systems/3_crdt.html">Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types</a>, <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/wave/whitepapers/operational-transform/operational-transform.html">Google's OT papers</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation">Wikipedia on Operational Transformation</a>. I did not find any glaring errors in the text. For future crawlers, <strong>the following text was generated by chatGPT on 2022-12-11T01:12:45+0000</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>bold</strong> is used for the prompts I send into chatGPT.</p>
<p><em>italics</em> is for my comments.</p>
<p><strong>can you explain CRDT's in data structures?</strong></p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/gpt/gpt-logo.png" class="img-fluid" width="5%" alt="gpt-logo" />
Sure! A Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) is a data structure that allows multiple copies of itself to be stored on different computers, and for those copies to be updated independently. This means that even when the copies are not connected to each other, they can still be updated and changed, and when they are eventually reconnected, they will automatically merge any conflicting changes in a way that preserves the consistency of the data. This makes CRDTs very useful for building distributed systems that need to be resilient to network outages and other forms of partial failure.</p>
<p><strong>Is this similar to Google Wave's Operational Transform?</strong></p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/gpt/gpt-logo.png" class="img-fluid" width="5%" alt="gpt-logo" />
Yes, Operational Transform (OT) is a technique that is related to CRDTs, and it is often used to solve the same kinds of problems. Like CRDTs, OT is a way of allowing multiple copies of a data structure to be updated independently and then merged together, but it uses a different approach to achieve this. OT works by applying a series of &quot;operations&quot; to the data, rather than directly modifying the data itself. This allows OT to detect and resolve conflicts between different copies of the data more easily, but it can also make it more complex to implement.</p>
<p><strong>Can you give me an example of a CRDT design?</strong></p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/gpt/gpt-logo.png" class="img-fluid" width="5%" alt="gpt-logo" />
Sure! One example of a CRDT is a &quot;g-counter,&quot; which is a data structure that stores a count. This data structure allows for the count to be incremented independently on different computers, and then merged together in a way that ensures that the final count is always correct. Here is one way that a g-counter could be implemented:</p>
<pre><code>class GCounter {
  Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; counts;

  void increment(String nodeId) {
    counts.put(nodeId, counts.getOrDefault(nodeId, 0) + 1);
  }

  void merge(GCounter other) {
    for (Map.Entry&lt;String, Integer&gt; entry : other.counts.entrySet()) {
      String nodeId = entry.getKey();
      int count = entry.getValue();
      counts.put(nodeId, Math.max(counts.getOrDefault(nodeId, 0), count));
    }
  }

  int getCount() {
    return counts.values().stream().mapToInt(x -&gt; x).sum();
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>I never specified a programming language, so assume this is a kind of pseudocode</em></p>
<p>In this implementation, the increment() method is used to increment the count on a particular node, and the merge() method is used to merge the counts from two different g-counters together. The getCount() method returns the current value of the count.</p>
<p><strong>And contrast with the design of an OT?</strong></p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/gpt/gpt-logo.png" class="img-fluid" width="5%" alt="gpt-logo" />
Here is an example of how an Operational Transform (OT) might be implemented for a simple text editing application:</p>
<pre><code>class TextBuffer {
  StringBuilder text;

  void applyOperation(Operation op) {
    int start = op.getStartIndex();
    int end = op.getEndIndex();
    String newText = op.getText();
    text.replace(start, end, newText);
  }

  String getText() {
    return text.toString();
  }
}

class Operation {
  int startIndex;
  int endIndex;
  String text;

  int getStartIndex() {
    return startIndex;
  }

  int getEndIndex() {
    return endIndex;
  }

  String getText() {
    return text;
  }

  Operation transform(Operation other) {
    // Compute the transformed version of this operation, given the other operation
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>I never specified a programming language, so assume this is a kind of pseudocode</em></p>
<p>In this example, the TextBuffer class represents the text being edited, and the Operation class represents a single edit operation (e.g. inserting or deleting some text). The applyOperation() method is used to apply an operation to the text buffer, and the getText() method is used to retrieve the current contents of the buffer. The transform() method is used to compute the transformed version of an operation, given another operation. This is used to ensure that concurrent operations on the same text buffer can be merged together consistently.</p>
<p>One key difference between this approach and the g-counter example is that OT explicitly tracks the operations that are applied to the data, rather than directly modifying the data itself. This makes it easier to detect and resolve conflicts between concurrent operations, but it also makes the implementation more complex.</p>
<p><strong>Can you list known CRDTs and their usage in a table?</strong></p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/gpt/gpt-logo.png" class="img-fluid" width="5%" alt="gpt-logo" />
Here is a list of some common Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), along with a brief description of each one and some potential use cases:</p>
<table class="table">

<p>These are just a few examples of CRDTs, and there are many other types of CRDTs that have been developed for different types of data and applications. In general, CRDTs can be useful whenever you need to store and update data in a distributed system, and you want to ensure that the data remains consistent even in the face of network partitions and other forms of partial failure.</p>
<p><strong>Can you make a similar table for OTs?</strong></p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/gpt/gpt-logo.png" class="img-fluid" width="5%" alt="gpt-logo" />

<p>Like CRDTs, there are many different OT techniques that have been developed for different types of data and applications, and this table only covers a few of the most common ones. In general, OTs can be useful whenever you need to support real-time collaboration on data, and you want to ensure that concurrent changes can be merged together consistently.</p>
<p><strong>is there a use case to use both CRDTs and OTs together?</strong></p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/gpt/gpt-logo.png" class="img-fluid" width="5%" alt="gpt-logo" />
It is possible to use Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) and Operational Transform (OT) techniques together in some cases, although this is not always necessary or desirable. Here are a few examples of situations where using both CRDTs and OTs together might be useful:</p>
<p>If you have a data structure that is very complex and cannot be easily represented using a single CRDT, you could use a combination of CRDTs and OTs to break the data structure down into smaller, simpler pieces that can be managed independently. For example, you could use a CRDT to store the overall structure of the data, and then use OTs to handle the details of how the individual pieces of the data are updated and changed.</p>
<p>If you have a data structure that is updated very frequently, and you need to ensure that updates can be applied and merged together quickly, you might use a CRDT to handle the &quot;big picture&quot; view of the data, and then use OTs to handle the finer-grained details of how the data is changed. This can help to reduce the amount of work that needs to be done in order to merge updates together, which can improve the overall performance of the system.</p>
<p>If you have a data structure that needs to support both offline and online updates, you might use a CRDT to handle the offline updates, and then use OTs to handle the online updates. This can allow the system to continue functioning even when the network is unavailable, and then automatically merge any offline updates with the online updates when the network becomes available again.</p>
<p>Overall, whether or not it makes sense to use CRDTs and OTs together in a particular system will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the system, as well as the trade-offs between the different approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any other similar types of data structures that also cover this space?</strong></p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/gpt/gpt-logo.png" class="img-fluid" width="5%" alt="gpt-logo" />
There are many different types of data structures and algorithms that can be used to solve similar problems to those addressed by Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) and Operational Transform (OT) techniques. Some examples of other approaches that are related to CRDTs and OTs include:</p>
<p>Replication protocols: These are algorithms that are used to manage the process of replicating data between different nodes in a distributed system. Replication protocols can be used to ensure that multiple copies of the data are kept consistent with each other, and that conflicts between different copies of the data are resolved in a way that preserves the integrity of the data.</p>
<p>Consensus algorithms: These are algorithms that are used to reach agreement on the state of a distributed system, even in the presence of faulty or malicious nodes. Consensus algorithms can be used to ensure that different nodes in the system have a consistent view of the data, and that updates to the data are applied in a way that is consistent with the consensus.</p>
<p>Distributed hash tables (DHTs): These are data structures that are used to store and retrieve data in a distributed system. DHTs use a hash function to map data to different nodes in the system, and they can be used to ensure that data is stored and retrieved in a consistent and efficient manner.</p>
<p>Distributed databases: These are databases that are designed to be used in a distributed system, and that provide mechanisms for storing, querying, and updating data in a way that is consistent and scalable. Distributed databases can use a variety of techniques, including CRDTs and OTs, to ensure that the data remains consistent and available even in the face of network partitions and other forms of partial failure.</p>
<p><strong>Give me a example of a consensus algorithm that computes the final state of a text document that is edited in realtime in multiple distributed computers. I'm looking at a peer to peer network without central authority.</strong></p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/gpt/gpt-logo.png" class="img-fluid" width="5%" alt="gpt-logo" />
One example of a consensus algorithm that could be used to compute the final state of a text document that is edited in realtime in multiple distributed computers is called the &quot;Paxos&quot; algorithm. This algorithm is a well-known method for reaching consensus in a distributed system, and it has been used in many different types of applications, including real-time collaborative text editing.</p>
<p>Here is a high-level overview of how the Paxos algorithm might be used to compute the final state of a text document that is being edited in realtime by multiple users:</p>
<p>Each user maintains a local copy of the text document, and as they make changes to the document, they also generate a sequence of &quot;operations&quot; that represent the changes they are making. These operations are sent to the other users in the network.</p>
<p>When a user receives an operation from another user, they apply the operation to their local copy of the document. This may result in conflicts with other operations that have already been applied to the document, in which case the user will need to resolve the conflicts in some way (e.g. by using Operational Transform (OT) techniques).</p>
<p>As the users continue to edit the document and generate new operations, they also participate in the Paxos consensus protocol. This involves sending messages to each other in order to agree on the sequence of operations that should be applied to the document. The messages are sent in a specific order, and they are used to ensure that all of the users eventually agree on the same sequence of operations.</p>
<p>Once all of the users have agreed on the sequence of operations, they can apply those operations to their local copies of the document in order to compute the final state of the document. This final state will be the same for all of the users, and it will reflect all of the changes that have been made to the document by any of the users.</p>
<p>The Paxos algorithm is a complex and subtle algorithm, and this is just a very high-level overview of how it might be used in this context. There are many different variations of the Paxos algorithm, and the specific details of how it is implemented will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the system.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p>Posted on Sunday, 4 December 2022</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/mjovanovictech">Milan Jovanović</a> tweet on <a href="https://twitter.com/mjovanovictech/status/1599124855542411264">5 reasons to use Redis for caching</a>,</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/caching/5reasonsCaching.png" class="img-fluid" width="80%" alt="" /></p>
<p>and <a href="https://twitter.com/danielmarbach">Daniel Marbach's</a> response &quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/danielmarbach/status/1599352526888849408">Now I want to see five reasons to avoid caching ✋😂</a>&quot;</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/caching/5reasonsNoCaching.png" class="img-fluid" width="80%" alt="" /></p>
<p>I found <a href="https://twitter.com/ThrowATwit/status/1599356806874427392">seven reasons to not introduce caching</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Caching can increase complexity in your application, as you need to manage the cached data and ensure it remains consistent with the underlying data store.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Caching can increase latency, as the cache itself introduces an additional lookup step.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Caching can be expensive, both in terms of the additional hardware and storage required for the cache, and the overhead of managing the cache itself.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Caching can be unreliable, as cached data can become stale or inconsistent if it is not adequately managed or invalidated.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Caching can be a security risk, as sensitive data that is stored in the cache may be vulnerable to unauthorized access or exposure. It takes additional effort to ensure that the correct authorizations are applied to cached data, increasing application complexity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Caching can be harder to debug. To determine why a piece of data is not being retrieved from the cache or is being retrieved from the underlying data store instead is difficult. This can make it challenging to diagnose and fix performance issues related to caching.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Caching can create additional maintenance overhead, as you need to monitor the cache and ensure it is working properly. Monitoring cache hit and miss rates, ensuring that the cache is not getting too full, and periodically purging expired or stale data from the cache.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>and a bonus <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/joslat/status/1599518029649678336">8.</a> from <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/joslat">Jose Luis Latorre</a>
&quot;8. It should be also properly tested, and stress tested... without mention the security testing as well should include a check on this layer too... which would bring us to point 3. More expensive ;)&quot;</p>
<p>Introducing Caching into any architecture is a decision that must be made with care. We have to ask if it helps us fulfill a business requirement (latency requirements), and improves quality or responsiveness for the end user. And we must ensure the solution is appropriate in terms of cost of operation and cost of monitoring and support. Additionally, the security aspects of a cache should be considered in the solution design.</p>
<p>In software architecture, there are very few single answers, everything is a compromise. Caching is a great hammer and use it when it is appropriate, but remember not every problem is a nail.</p>

<p>In software architecture, I find myself reaching more and more for tools that I can use to generate representations from a simple textual description, be it generated from a tool or hand written. And sometimes, nothing generated looks nice, so I have to do draw it myself!</p>
<p>Here are a few of the tools I have recently used, for different purposes:</p>
<h2 id="diagrams-as-code">Diagrams as code:</h2>
<h3 id="mermaid">Mermaid</h3>
<p>Mermaid is a language to generate flow charts, pie charts, entity relation diagrams and several other diagrams. I’ve used it in internal documentation and blog posts. The graph description language is simple enough that you can write code to generate charts, too.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/">https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A live editor is also available online:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mermaid.live/">https://mermaid.live/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Mermaid rendering has been integrated into several markdown renderers, GitHub markdown and VS Code both support it.</p>

<h3 id="python-diagrams">Python Diagrams</h3>
<p>Python has a diagram library which has icons for most programming tools, from Airflow to ZeroMQ. You design the diagram with simple Python code and it uses the Graphviz library to render png images. Highly recommended for small architecture diagrams that just need a dozen or so elements.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/">https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve also done some pull requests to add symbols to the library and I recommend you do so too if you have elements that are missing in your diagrams.</p>

<li><a href="https://plantuml.com/">https://plantuml.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>PlantUML also has a live editor online:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/">https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, I’ve used it quite seldomly, being able to cover most requirements with Mermaid and Python Diagrams.</p>
<h3 id="d2">D2</h3>
<p>D2 has recently been open-sourced and made available. I haven't yet had time to test it.</p>

<h2 id="diagrams-as-drawing">Diagrams as Drawing:</h2>
<h3 id="diagrams">Diagrams</h3>
<p>Diagrams.net has both an online and an offline version of a vector drawing software that works exceedingly well for software architecture illustrations. With symbols for most public cloud platforms included in their delectable libraries, you’ll be able to find the right symbol you need.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.diagrams.net/">https://www.diagrams.net/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There’s even a Visual Studio Code extension for editing a diagram inside the IDE. Export can be done to PNG easily. Diagrams produced are easily embedded in Atlassian’s wiki and other wiki products.</p>
<p>Highly recommend if you need to place your architecture elements instead of relying on the auto layout of diagrams as code. Now I just wish that the diagrams as code tools could create a diagram baseline compatible with this tool to modify the layout.</p>
<h3 id="archi-archimate-modelling">Archi (Archimate modelling)</h3>
<p>If you use the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArchiMate">Archimate modelling language</a>, then this is the tool for you to build your modelling concepts. The formalism is great for making something that everyone can “read” once trained on it, but the investment can be quite high to do the correct modelling of your infrastructure with this tool.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.archimatetool.com/">https://www.archimatetool.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I used the Local application running on Windows.</p>
<h4 id="online-architecture-repositories">Online architecture repositories</h4>
<p>There is also online hosted versions of architecture repository tools using Archimate <a href="https://www.boc-group.com/en/adoit/">Adoit EA Suite</a> and an associated community version too.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there's also:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mega.com/hopex-platform">Hopex's MEGA</a> which I only used as it was being decommissioned</li>
<li><a href="https://sparxsystems.com/products/ea/index.html">Sparx Systems’ Enterprise Architect</a> which I used for a short amount of time before the company standardised on Adoit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="yed">yEd</h3>
<p>In writing this article, I discovered the tool yEd and wanted to mention it for completeness, I haven't had the opportunity to use it yet. It does mention many of the illustration types that are useful (BPML, Flowcharts, UML, ...).</p>

<h2 id="diagrams-from-programming">Diagrams from programming:</h2>
<p>Now these are more out there and not always directly applicable, but when you need a visualisation that the above tools cannot do, it’s time to break out these applications.</p>
<h3 id="d3js">D3js</h3>
<p>Not sure if I need to introduce D3js,  it is probably one of the most commonly use and important is visualisation libraries. Used in everything from maps to genomics to economic data. It can do it all.</p>
<p><a href="https://d3js.org/">https://d3js.org/</a></p>
<p>I previously used d3js to embed charts of price curves generated from market data, overlapped with the delivery period of energy instruments.</p>
<h3 id="processing.js">Processing.js</h3>
<p>Animated heart pulsating on a field of scintillating gold lace? Yes. That and many more things! Processing excels in the visual demos, animations and more. You’ll have to code it, but it’s no issue to get your custom Mandelbrot animated render and many more. Has interactions with sound and many more features. Does have a high bar of entry though and it takes a while to be productive with it.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://processing.org/">https://processing.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="graphviz">Graphviz</h3>
<p>I would be remiss if I didn’t mention Graphviz. It is the library used to generate diagrams from textual descriptions using one of their many languages, Dot being one of them.</p>
<p>Not something I use directly but more indirect usages via the Python diagrams library. You can learn it’s language and create charts.</p>
<ul>

<h2 id="online-services-collaborative">Online services (collaborative)</h2>
<p>When you need online collaboration, which the tools above do not cover, you can turn to the following services.</p>
<h3 id="miro">Miro</h3>
<p>I’ve had the most experience with Miro while running large organisation meetings as a place to collect ideas, do feedback rounds and generally plan activities.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://miro.com">https://miro.com</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lucidspark-lucidchart-and-lucidscale">LucidSpark, LucidChart and LucidScale</h3>
<p>Both collaboration and vector illustration online software. Also their ability with lucid scale to connect and document your cloud infrastructure is very impressive and helps to keep you infrastructure maps updated.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/">https://www.lucidchart.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, it’s one that I’ve not had the opportunity to use very often, usually because it was covered by other tools and no one else in the company was using it. But you should check it out to see if it does work for you and your team.</p>
<h3 id="microsoft-whiteboard">Microsoft Whiteboard</h3>
<p>When all else fails, there’s Microsoft whiteboard. It works, there’s an online version, an integration in teams, a desktop app and even an iOS / iPadOS application. More suited to drawing with a pen, then it becomes a great collaborative whiteboard. I have given internal talks using a Microsoft Whiteboard as a backdrop. I really like to start small and progressively zoom out on these massive canvases.</p>

<h2 id="mind-maps">Mind maps</h2>
<p>I don't use mind maps very often anymore. I was taught to use them as a child, but haven't kept up the practice. I'm just adding a couple of references in case you are looking for them:</p>
<h3 id="vscode-mindmap">vscode-mindmap</h3>
<p>I've used vscode-mindmap when I needed to create a quick hierarchy map.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There’s no one tool for everything in this day and age. Use what works for you and try out several to see if they stick!</p>
<p>I highly recommend generating some charts in mermaid from your own database ER-Diagram (easy to do!) or using it to make pie charts like <a href="https://youtu.be/IXRGa5m-Lbo">Microsoft Polyglot notebooks demonstrates at 15:05 onwards</a> in their <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/blob/main/samples/notebooks/polyglot/github%20repo%20milestone%20report.ipynb">GitHub demo notebook</a>.</p>
<p>If you have other recommendations for me, do feel free to reach out and I’ll see if they make to cut to get added to this list. :) You can even pull request this actual blog post on GitHub.</p>
<p>Finally, if someone has a recommendation for a WAN/LAN topology visualisation or charting tool, I’d be happy to hear about it and your experience with it!</p>

                        <h2>Data Lineage for dataflow and workflow processes</h2>
                    </a>
                    <p>Posted on Saturday, 12 November 2022</p>
<h1 id="data-lineage">Data lineage</h1>
<p>When working with large amounts of data, extraction, transforms and loads procedures can hide the source of the original data and make inquiries on &quot;where did this data come from and what happened to it?&quot; difficult to answer.</p>
<p>A data lineage is &quot;the process of understanding, recording, and visualizing data as it flows from data sources to consumption<a id="fnref:1" href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>&quot; and tries to answer that question.</p>
<p>Using dataflow and ETL orchestration tools such as <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Airflow</a>, <a href="https://www.prefect.io">Prefect</a>, <a href="https://nifi.apache.org/">NiFi</a>, we move and transform data, but also lose the reference as to how the data was transformed.</p>
<p>In this document, we will approach one open source tool OpenLineage and one &quot;hand built&quot; approach to capturing and storing data lineage information.</p>
<h1 id="openlineage-and-marquez-open-source-tools">OpenLineage and Marquez - Open source tools</h1>
<p><a href="https://openlineage.io/">OpenLineage</a> is an open source project and framework for data lineage collection and analysis that helps collect lineage metadata from the data  processing applications. At its core, OpenLineage exposes a standard API for metadata collection - a single API call: <a href="https://openlineage.io/apidocs/openapi/"><strong>postRunEvent</strong></a>.</p>
<p>To simplify its implementation with AirFlow, Open Lineage has an <a href="https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/main/integration/airflow/openlineage/airflow">airflow connection module</a> already available.</p>
<p>On the back-end, the storage of run meta-data has a reference implementation named Marquez. The data model is illustrated here.</p>
<p><a href="https://lucid.app/lucidchart/f918ce01-9eb4-4900-b266-49935da271b8/view?page=8xAE.zxyknLQ#">Marquez data model</a></p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/data-lineage/Marquez-Data-Model.png" class="img-fluid" width="80%" alt="" /></p>
<p>But it is also possible to implement one's own storage for metadata in case there is a need or added value, but adopting the open source solution will be an advantage for integration later.</p>
<h1 id="locally-grown-alternatives">Locally grown alternatives</h1>
<p>Data correlation and lineage information can be generated via the emission of events while processing input data. Additionally, input data can be fingerprinted via a fast hash function to check for duplicate imports, so as to enable idempotent processing.</p>
<h3 id="input-dataset-fingerprinting-via-non-cryptographic-hash-function">Input dataset fingerprinting via non-cryptographic hash function</h3>
<p>We can use a fast non-cryptographic hash function such as <a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/umash">umash</a> to generate a hash of the input data or xxhash <code>sudo apt-get install xxhash</code>. xxhash is capable of taking streaming STDIN data from compressed files to generate a fast hash.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">time gunzip -c /mnt/d/smart_meter_data/ckw_opendata_smartmeter_dataset_a_202101.csv.gz | /usr/bin/xxhsum
</code></pre>
<h3 id="correlation-ids-with-uuids">Correlation IDs with UUIDs</h3>
<p>Generating uuid for correlations identifiers along <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122.html">rfc4122</a> gives us multiple variant generation algorithms to give us sortable UUIDs which minimize collision possibilities even with a high UUID generation rate.</p>
<h3 id="hierarchical-correlation-ids-using-closure-tables">Hierarchical correlation IDs using closure tables</h3>
<p>When inputs contain a dataset that is composed of multiple data points that identify unique sets in our final processed dataset, it becomes necessary to be able to trace their lineage back to the initial input. A recursive search through a table of entries to find the parent correlation identifier of a child time-series is quite inefficient.</p>
<p>To have fast search over deep hierarchies of correlations IDs in relational databases, we can turn to the concept of closure tables.</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;">Field</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">Type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">ParentId</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">UUID</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">ChildId</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">UUID</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Depth</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">integer</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This table structure allows to query in one query all parent or children of an identifier in one non-recursive sql query. This is done at the cost of having to insert the entire hierarchy of the correlationIDs upon insertion.</p>
<p>Here we are representing the two hierarchies</p>
<pre><code>aaa &gt; bbb &gt; ccc
aaa &gt; eee 
</code></pre>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;">ParentId</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">ChildId</th>

<td style="text-align: left;">ccc</td>

<td style="text-align: right;">2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">aaa</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">eee</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><em>note</em>: <em>if desired the initial 0 depth nodes can be neglected from the insertion process without losing functionality, but can be useful in certain modeling processes (eg. rights, groups)</em></p>
<p>If we need to find all children of <strong>aaa</strong>, we can do a</p>
<pre><code>SELECT ChildId, Depth FROM Closure_Table WHERE ParentId = &quot;aaa&quot; ORDER BY Depth;
</code></pre>
<p>which returns the following</p>

<h3 id="solution-design">Solution design</h3>
<p>A rabbitMQ message queue to receive correlation events emitted by the tasks, with several consumer tasks receiving and committing to the database is a preferred approach over an HTTP 1.1 connection due the the scaling efficiency of AMQP over pure HTTP<a id="fnref:3" href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>

    d -- failed --&gt; e[[RabbitMQ Queue Deadletter]] --&gt; f[DLQ processing and Reconciliation] --&gt; g
</code></pre>
<p>A particular focus on the monitoring of the solution is necessary to truly have an operational system. The RabbitMQ should be a redundant, instrumented and reported to Graphana, with a queue length monitoring in place. The EventReceivers should employ a dead letter queue in case message are rejected by the database. These rejected messages could also also be a uuid collision - which can be treated by the daily reconciliation process and DeadLetter queue processing.</p>
<p>A high availability Postgresql is recommended, either as a local instance or as a cloud hosted service - which would facilitate operations.</p>
<p>The issue of Data retention should be discussed with Business. If we do not keep a time-series history in the time-series datastore, then the event correlation become actually an <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-sourcing.html">event sourcing pattern</a>, enabling to re-create the history of how the time-series was updated.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Irrespective of the method chosen to capture and store the messages, the systems chosen must provide a high availability solution for data lineage - but must be sure to not block ingestion if the data lineage system is unresponsive. As long as the message queue is persistent and accessible, it can always be caught up later.</p>
<p>The main task is emitting the events with meaningful data and unique correlation IDs. A focus on the semantics of the events while developing the workflow / dataflows is primordial. A callable event library provides the best developer experience to maximize standardization of code</p>
<p>The design of idempotent imports into the system is important, it allows to replay events non-destructively and provides operational resilience.</p>
