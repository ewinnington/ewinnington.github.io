                    </a>
                    <p>Posted on Wednesday, 9 November 2022</p>
<h1 id="tesla-megapacks">Tesla Megapacks</h1>
<p>Tesla on Twitter announced: <a href="https://t.co/aw85eHECXI">&quot;Meet Megafactory, our new Megapack factory in Lathrop, CA 🔋🔋🔋&quot;</a></p>
<p>Tesla's energy division has recently completed their new Megapack factory in Lathrop California , which they claim can produce currently 10'000 Megapacks a year. How much storage is that and how does this compare to a Hydropower pump storage plant?</p>
<h2 id="tesla-megapacks-specs-per-pack">Tesla megapacks Specs per pack</h2>
<ul>
<li>4 Hour Duration</li>
<li>Power: 970 kW</li>
<li>Energy: 3,916 kWh per Megapack</li>
<li>Round Trip Efficiency: 93.5%</li>
<li>9.12 m x 1.65 m x 2.79 m</li>
<li>38,100 kg</li>
<li>~$2 million per pack</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="offer">Offer</h2>
<p>An offer was generated on the Tesla Energy website to get an appropriate pricing for the largest system they offer.</p>
<ul>
<li>1000 Megapack</li>
<li>969.6 MW Power</li>
<li>3916 MWh Energy Megapack</li>
<li>Duration: 4 Hours</li>
<li>Delivery: Q3 2024</li>
<li>Estimated Price (California) $1,832,519,850</li>
<li>Est. Annual Maintenance $4,821,480 - Maintenance Price escalates at 2% per year</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this, we can see that 10'000 megapacks represent about 39160 MWh of storage (39 GWh), with a sales cost of approx $18 billion.</p>
<p>So how does this compare to the two latest large Swiss Pump-Storage Hydropowerplants?</p>
<h2 id="hydropower-plants">Hydropower plants</h2>
<h3 id="nant-de-drance-pump-storage-extension">Nant-de-Drance pump-storage extension</h3>

<li>Storage 20 GWh</li>
<li>Duration: 19 Hours</li>
<li>Round trip efficiency: over 90%</li>
<li>Estimated Price 2 billion CHF</li>
<li>~14 years to build and bring into operation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="kraftwerk-linthlimmern-pump-storage-extension">Kraftwerk-Linth–Limmern pump-storage extension</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 Pump-storage power plant</li>
<li>Power 1000 MW (Turbines and Pumps)</li>
<li>Storage 33 GWh</li>
<li>Duration: 33 Hours</li>
<li>Round trip efficiency: over 90%</li>
<li>Estimated Price 2.1 billion CHF</li>
<li>~10 years to build and bring into operation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The storage cost of the batteries is currently about a factor 4-9x the price of the hydropower plant construction but have the advantage of being available within about 18 months. What remains to be seen is how much battery degradation is a factor in these grid scale battery installations. At least Tesla is offering, from my understanding, a 15 year warranty on the Megapack.</p>
<p>The amount of storage produced by the factory represents more than 1 large hydropower plant per year.</p>
<p>The 39 GWh storage produced by the factory in one year is a huge amount, so much that it would cover around 25% of the <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/battery-storage-capability-by-countries-2020-and-2026">expected total capacity that the IEA planned for the entire world by 2026</a>.</p>

                        <h2>Embracing SQLite and living with micro-services</h2>
                    </a>
                    <p>Posted on Saturday, 22 October 2022</p>
<p>The idea of micro-services and their own single purpose data stores is easy to describe. But then to implement and live with it is a different story. So as a developer and architect, I’ve decided to do just that! Make micro-services and micro-data stores to cover the tiny and small stuff in my life I want to keep track of.</p>
<p>As an example, I read online comics, light novels and mangas. I had a continuous list of a couple hundred bookmarks that I tried to keep updated with the last position I was when I read the story. But I always forget to update the bookmark and have so many of them that I lose the last read chapter. My solution?</p>
<p>A SQLite db and some Python code to load it. Pass a single url on some command line Python and it gets added to the Db, a Request goes out, gets the title and chapter from the html, then adds it to the DB by title. Now I have a track of where I left off and I can get have last updated / last read records. Bonus, I can do a SELECT .. ORDER BY updated LIMIT 10 to check the last stories I was reading and pipe them to my browser to open up the chapters where I left them off.</p>
<p>To really embrace SQLite is to make everything in your life become a new micro database, even if there's only a couple of tables with a dozen or a hundred rows.</p>
<p>Stock tracking? an SQLite Db with Transactions and a roll-up Inventory table.</p>
<p>In fact, even when sending data around from one system to another, we should even embrace the simplicity of SQLite over CSV files. See <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/big-data-storage/">https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/big-data-storage/</a> for his views and performance tests.</p>
<p>Now I have micro data-stores, I can add a service on top which contains the CRUD commands I need to interact with them and show them in a personal dashboard.</p>

                        <h2>The case for a SpaceX Starship laser ablation platform for orbital debris management</h2>
                    </a>
                    <p>Posted on Sunday, 18 September 2022</p>
<p>SpaceX’s Starship program as a platform for specialised load-outs has many potential applications: Tanker variants for orbital refuelling, Crew variant for Dear Moon mission and dedicated satellite launcher for the Starlink satellite constellation deployment being the variants we already know about.</p>
<p>With the latest discussion about Orbital debris fields, I suggest it is time to discuss about another variant: a dedicated laser ablation Starship variant for de-orbiting or destroying 1 to 10 cm sized debris.</p>
<p>To deorbit or destroy debris in Earth’s orbit, laser ablation is one of the ideal techniques to use since it can directly burn up small debris or  deorbit larger ones via plasma propulsion (in effect, burning up the target object and causing it to be propelled by the plasma generated by the laser hitting the target).</p>
<p>To be able to make orbital cleanup affordable, we need to have a cheap to fly, high power laser with a sufficient burn time and have the ability to choose the orbit of our laser platform.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cheap to fly: The launch costs of a SpaceX starship is estimated to be at least one order of magnitude less in dollar per kilo to orbit.</li>
<li>High power laser: The high power of chemical lasers along with their high mass requirements make them a good fit for integration into a Starship. With sufficient mass for the chemicals to supply the laser, the lasers could be used long enough to clear the coplanar orbit. Once the chemicals are depleted, the starship can be landed and the laser refuelled for another mission. Other types of lasers, which have been developed recently, are also candidates: Solid state lasers, fiber lasers, diode lasers - with these the mass capability of Starship would be used for large batteries and potentially hydrogen fuel cells to provide enough power for the application.</li>
<li>Ability to choose orbit: Laser ablation is most effective when the platform if shooting from a “same altitude and coplanar” orbit. Different launches are then the most effective way of reaching these orbits to get maximal efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90789865/orbits-act-what-to-know-about-congress-effort-to-clean-up-space-debris">US government decides to start paying for orbital clearing services</a> with the Orbital Clearance with the Orbital Sustainability (ORBITS) Act, it would be a clear case to develop such a Starship variant. Without other incentives, it might still be profitable by selling “deorbiting and clearance services” to other satellite providers. This remains to be seen how much “good citizenship” is to be expected from satellite constructors, launchers and operators.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p>Posted on Friday, 14 January 2022</p>
<p>As humanity left for the stars, bacteria hitched a ride with us. They were on us, in us and around us - as much part of us as our own cells. Viruses, on the other hand, due to careful screening programs, quarantines and selective breeding programs of the few animals that took to the stars, were confined to the gravity well of Earth. Without hosts, they could not follow us. We had left our ancient enemy behind.</p>
<p>Within two generations, the space born growing up on the O’Neill colony cylinders - even those who lived at 0.9 to 1g - realised that earth was going to be a forbidden planet for them. They had no defences against the viruses that continued to permeate the planet. A visit to earth required them to live in an isolation suit and sterile quarters - limiting contact with the earthers and fauna.</p>
