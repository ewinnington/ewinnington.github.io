<p>I am in the process of setting up my homelab network between my two locations.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/network/network.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" alt="Network" /></p>

<li>Minis3 and Minis4 are the Beelink MiniS12 N95s running Ubuntu Server 23.04.</li>

<p>With a L2TP VPN connection configured to allow remote access onto the network, so I can get Red (Surface Laptop) and Xr (iPhone) onto the network in case.</p>
<h2 id="zone-n">Zone N</h2>
<p>N has two connections, a Starlink (v1 round) with only the powerbrick router and Sosh as a backup DSL provider (with an ADSL Router) both connected to a Ubiquity UDM-PRO-SE in Failover mode. Getting a VPN to N is a little more involved, since the UDM is behind a separate router on each WAN.</p>
<h3 id="inventory-1">Inventory</h3>
<ul>
<li>Minis1 is the Beelink MiniS12 N95s running Windows 11. Planned to Switch to Ubuntu 23.04, but enjoying it VESA mounted behind a screen in the office currently.</li>
<li>Minis2 is the Beelink MiniS12 N95s running Ubuntu Server 23.04. Currently rackmounted with the UDM-PRO.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vpn-1">VPN</h3>
<p>On the UDM-PRO, a VPN is configured with Ubiquity and I can use the iOS application WifiMan to access the network.
On Minis2, a <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared">cloudflared docker</a> is running, reaching up to Cloudflare and providing an Zero trust tunnel to expose several dockerized websites hosted on it.</p>
<h1 id="the-issue-at-hand">The issue at hand</h1>
<p>I would like the N Minis1 &amp; Minis2 to be able to access the Z NAS, ideally with a relatively simple connection that I can leave running all the time, to be able to pull files from the NAS and ideally also access the NAS's front-end application from inside my N location. I could connect to the SwisscomVPN every time I do something that requires connectivity to the NAS, but I would really ideally like a more permanent solution where I make the Z NAS &quot;visible&quot; in the N network. Or go full and establish a site-to-site VPN and simply make the two areas N and Z communicate seamlessly while still having local connectivity.</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions as to how best to accomplish this?</p>

<p>I recently purchased (arrived yesterday!) two mini PCs, for 170.- CHF each (~$187). They sport the latest low power CPU from Intel, the N95, which is amazingly efficient, powerful and cheap.</p>
<p>The Beelink Mini S12 with the N95 intel CPU 4c, 16 GB Ram, 512 GB NVME storage drive, with space for an additional 2.5&quot; SSD inside too. Amazingly small and light to carry around.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/minipc.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="80%" alt="" />
(coffee cup for scale)</p>
<p>I just got two of these to put in a Kubernetes cluster, and I've been playing around with them and they are super impressive. They pack a punch and sip power at 9-20W. The internal video card does 4k youtube playback without any issue.</p>
<p>Windows 11 comes included with the machine for the price. I've already put ubuntu server on one of them. These machines are powerful enough for family members to do all their online activities, zoom (with a webcam), or use as a media machine.</p>
<p>Over the next weeks, I'll be documenting configuring them and setting them up to serve as highly available servers from my home, using a reverse VPN tunneling.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p>Posted on Sunday, 11 December 2022</p>
<p>I have been enjoying using <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">chatGPT</a> as a private tutor / reference on topics. My biggest issue is now keeping up with the knowledge and asking the right questions.</p>
<p>But, remember that chatGPT is not all knowing and can get things wrong - even fabulating, so you have to double check the information. I did my best to validate the information with <a href="https://mwhittaker.github.io/consistency_in_distributed_systems/3_crdt.html">Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types</a>, <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/wave/whitepapers/operational-transform/operational-transform.html">Google's OT papers</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation">Wikipedia on Operational Transformation</a>. I did not find any glaring errors in the text. For future crawlers, <strong>the following text was generated by chatGPT on 2022-12-11T01:12:45+0000</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>bold</strong> is used for the prompts I send into chatGPT.</p>
<p><em>italics</em> is for my comments.</p>
<p><strong>can you explain CRDT's in data structures?</strong></p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/gpt/gpt-logo.png" class="img-fluid" width="5%" alt="gpt-logo" />
Sure! A Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) is a data structure that allows multiple copies of itself to be stored on different computers, and for those copies to be updated independently. This means that even when the copies are not connected to each other, they can still be updated and changed, and when they are eventually reconnected, they will automatically merge any conflicting changes in a way that preserves the consistency of the data. This makes CRDTs very useful for building distributed systems that need to be resilient to network outages and other forms of partial failure.</p>
<p><strong>Is this similar to Google Wave's Operational Transform?</strong></p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/gpt/gpt-logo.png" class="img-fluid" width="5%" alt="gpt-logo" />
Yes, Operational Transform (OT) is a technique that is related to CRDTs, and it is often used to solve the same kinds of problems. Like CRDTs, OT is a way of allowing multiple copies of a data structure to be updated independently and then merged together, but it uses a different approach to achieve this. OT works by applying a series of &quot;operations&quot; to the data, rather than directly modifying the data itself. This allows OT to detect and resolve conflicts between different copies of the data more easily, but it can also make it more complex to implement.</p>
<p><strong>Can you give me an example of a CRDT design?</strong></p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/gpt/gpt-logo.png" class="img-fluid" width="5%" alt="gpt-logo" />
Sure! One example of a CRDT is a &quot;g-counter,&quot; which is a data structure that stores a count. This data structure allows for the count to be incremented independently on different computers, and then merged together in a way that ensures that the final count is always correct. Here is one way that a g-counter could be implemented:</p>
<pre><code>class GCounter {
  Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; counts;

  void increment(String nodeId) {
    counts.put(nodeId, counts.getOrDefault(nodeId, 0) + 1);
  }

  void merge(GCounter other) {
    for (Map.Entry&lt;String, Integer&gt; entry : other.counts.entrySet()) {
      String nodeId = entry.getKey();
      int count = entry.getValue();
      counts.put(nodeId, Math.max(counts.getOrDefault(nodeId, 0), count));
    }
  }

  int getCount() {
    return counts.values().stream().mapToInt(x -&gt; x).sum();
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>I never specified a programming language, so assume this is a kind of pseudocode</em></p>
<p>In this implementation, the increment() method is used to increment the count on a particular node, and the merge() method is used to merge the counts from two different g-counters together. The getCount() method returns the current value of the count.</p>
<p><strong>And contrast with the design of an OT?</strong></p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/gpt/gpt-logo.png" class="img-fluid" width="5%" alt="gpt-logo" />
Here is an example of how an Operational Transform (OT) might be implemented for a simple text editing application:</p>
<pre><code>class TextBuffer {
  StringBuilder text;

  void applyOperation(Operation op) {
    int start = op.getStartIndex();
    int end = op.getEndIndex();
    String newText = op.getText();
    text.replace(start, end, newText);
  }

  String getText() {
    return text.toString();
  }
}

class Operation {
  int startIndex;
  int endIndex;
  String text;

  int getStartIndex() {
    return startIndex;
  }

  int getEndIndex() {
    return endIndex;
  }

  String getText() {
    return text;
  }

  Operation transform(Operation other) {
    // Compute the transformed version of this operation, given the other operation
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>I never specified a programming language, so assume this is a kind of pseudocode</em></p>
<p>In this example, the TextBuffer class represents the text being edited, and the Operation class represents a single edit operation (e.g. inserting or deleting some text). The applyOperation() method is used to apply an operation to the text buffer, and the getText() method is used to retrieve the current contents of the buffer. The transform() method is used to compute the transformed version of an operation, given another operation. This is used to ensure that concurrent operations on the same text buffer can be merged together consistently.</p>
<p>One key difference between this approach and the g-counter example is that OT explicitly tracks the operations that are applied to the data, rather than directly modifying the data itself. This makes it easier to detect and resolve conflicts between concurrent operations, but it also makes the implementation more complex.</p>
<p><strong>Can you list known CRDTs and their usage in a table?</strong></p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/gpt/gpt-logo.png" class="img-fluid" width="5%" alt="gpt-logo" />
Here is a list of some common Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), along with a brief description of each one and some potential use cases:</p>

<p>These are just a few examples of CRDTs, and there are many other types of CRDTs that have been developed for different types of data and applications. In general, CRDTs can be useful whenever you need to store and update data in a distributed system, and you want to ensure that the data remains consistent even in the face of network partitions and other forms of partial failure.</p>
<p><strong>Can you make a similar table for OTs?</strong></p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/gpt/gpt-logo.png" class="img-fluid" width="5%" alt="gpt-logo" />
Sure! Here is a table that lists some common Operational Transform (OT) techniques, along with a brief description of each one and some potential use cases:</p>

<p>Like CRDTs, there are many different OT techniques that have been developed for different types of data and applications, and this table only covers a few of the most common ones. In general, OTs can be useful whenever you need to support real-time collaboration on data, and you want to ensure that concurrent changes can be merged together consistently.</p>
<p><strong>is there a use case to use both CRDTs and OTs together?</strong></p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/gpt/gpt-logo.png" class="img-fluid" width="5%" alt="gpt-logo" />
It is possible to use Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) and Operational Transform (OT) techniques together in some cases, although this is not always necessary or desirable. Here are a few examples of situations where using both CRDTs and OTs together might be useful:</p>
<p>If you have a data structure that is very complex and cannot be easily represented using a single CRDT, you could use a combination of CRDTs and OTs to break the data structure down into smaller, simpler pieces that can be managed independently. For example, you could use a CRDT to store the overall structure of the data, and then use OTs to handle the details of how the individual pieces of the data are updated and changed.</p>
<p>If you have a data structure that is updated very frequently, and you need to ensure that updates can be applied and merged together quickly, you might use a CRDT to handle the &quot;big picture&quot; view of the data, and then use OTs to handle the finer-grained details of how the data is changed. This can help to reduce the amount of work that needs to be done in order to merge updates together, which can improve the overall performance of the system.</p>
<p>If you have a data structure that needs to support both offline and online updates, you might use a CRDT to handle the offline updates, and then use OTs to handle the online updates. This can allow the system to continue functioning even when the network is unavailable, and then automatically merge any offline updates with the online updates when the network becomes available again.</p>
<p>Overall, whether or not it makes sense to use CRDTs and OTs together in a particular system will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the system, as well as the trade-offs between the different approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any other similar types of data structures that also cover this space?</strong></p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/gpt/gpt-logo.png" class="img-fluid" width="5%" alt="gpt-logo" />
There are many different types of data structures and algorithms that can be used to solve similar problems to those addressed by Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) and Operational Transform (OT) techniques. Some examples of other approaches that are related to CRDTs and OTs include:</p>
<p>Replication protocols: These are algorithms that are used to manage the process of replicating data between different nodes in a distributed system. Replication protocols can be used to ensure that multiple copies of the data are kept consistent with each other, and that conflicts between different copies of the data are resolved in a way that preserves the integrity of the data.</p>
<p>Consensus algorithms: These are algorithms that are used to reach agreement on the state of a distributed system, even in the presence of faulty or malicious nodes. Consensus algorithms can be used to ensure that different nodes in the system have a consistent view of the data, and that updates to the data are applied in a way that is consistent with the consensus.</p>
<p>Distributed hash tables (DHTs): These are data structures that are used to store and retrieve data in a distributed system. DHTs use a hash function to map data to different nodes in the system, and they can be used to ensure that data is stored and retrieved in a consistent and efficient manner.</p>
<p>Distributed databases: These are databases that are designed to be used in a distributed system, and that provide mechanisms for storing, querying, and updating data in a way that is consistent and scalable. Distributed databases can use a variety of techniques, including CRDTs and OTs, to ensure that the data remains consistent and available even in the face of network partitions and other forms of partial failure.</p>
<p><strong>Give me a example of a consensus algorithm that computes the final state of a text document that is edited in realtime in multiple distributed computers. I'm looking at a peer to peer network without central authority.</strong></p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/gpt/gpt-logo.png" class="img-fluid" width="5%" alt="gpt-logo" />
One example of a consensus algorithm that could be used to compute the final state of a text document that is edited in realtime in multiple distributed computers is called the &quot;Paxos&quot; algorithm. This algorithm is a well-known method for reaching consensus in a distributed system, and it has been used in many different types of applications, including real-time collaborative text editing.</p>
<p>Here is a high-level overview of how the Paxos algorithm might be used to compute the final state of a text document that is being edited in realtime by multiple users:</p>
<p>Each user maintains a local copy of the text document, and as they make changes to the document, they also generate a sequence of &quot;operations&quot; that represent the changes they are making. These operations are sent to the other users in the network.</p>
<p>When a user receives an operation from another user, they apply the operation to their local copy of the document. This may result in conflicts with other operations that have already been applied to the document, in which case the user will need to resolve the conflicts in some way (e.g. by using Operational Transform (OT) techniques).</p>
<p>As the users continue to edit the document and generate new operations, they also participate in the Paxos consensus protocol. This involves sending messages to each other in order to agree on the sequence of operations that should be applied to the document. The messages are sent in a specific order, and they are used to ensure that all of the users eventually agree on the same sequence of operations.</p>
<p>Once all of the users have agreed on the sequence of operations, they can apply those operations to their local copies of the document in order to compute the final state of the document. This final state will be the same for all of the users, and it will reflect all of the changes that have been made to the document by any of the users.</p>
<p>The Paxos algorithm is a complex and subtle algorithm, and this is just a very high-level overview of how it might be used in this context. There are many different variations of the Paxos algorithm, and the specific details of how it is implemented will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the system.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p>Posted on Sunday, 4 December 2022</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/mjovanovictech">Milan Jovanović</a> tweet on <a href="https://twitter.com/mjovanovictech/status/1599124855542411264">5 reasons to use Redis for caching</a>,</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/caching/5reasonsCaching.png" class="img-fluid" width="80%" alt="" /></p>
<p>and <a href="https://twitter.com/danielmarbach">Daniel Marbach's</a> response &quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/danielmarbach/status/1599352526888849408">Now I want to see five reasons to avoid caching ✋😂</a>&quot;</p>
<p><img src="/posts/images/caching/5reasonsNoCaching.png" class="img-fluid" width="80%" alt="" /></p>
<p>I found <a href="https://twitter.com/ThrowATwit/status/1599356806874427392">seven reasons to not introduce caching</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Caching can increase complexity in your application, as you need to manage the cached data and ensure it remains consistent with the underlying data store.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Caching can increase latency, as the cache itself introduces an additional lookup step.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Caching can be expensive, both in terms of the additional hardware and storage required for the cache, and the overhead of managing the cache itself.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Caching can be unreliable, as cached data can become stale or inconsistent if it is not adequately managed or invalidated.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Caching can be a security risk, as sensitive data that is stored in the cache may be vulnerable to unauthorized access or exposure. It takes additional effort to ensure that the correct authorizations are applied to cached data, increasing application complexity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Caching can be harder to debug. To determine why a piece of data is not being retrieved from the cache or is being retrieved from the underlying data store instead is difficult. This can make it challenging to diagnose and fix performance issues related to caching.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Caching can create additional maintenance overhead, as you need to monitor the cache and ensure it is working properly. Monitoring cache hit and miss rates, ensuring that the cache is not getting too full, and periodically purging expired or stale data from the cache.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>and a bonus <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/joslat/status/1599518029649678336">8.</a> from <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/joslat">Jose Luis Latorre</a>
&quot;8. It should be also properly tested, and stress tested... without mention the security testing as well should include a check on this layer too... which would bring us to point 3. More expensive ;)&quot;</p>
<p>Introducing Caching into any architecture is a decision that must be made with care. We have to ask if it helps us fulfill a business requirement (latency requirements), and improves quality or responsiveness for the end user. And we must ensure the solution is appropriate in terms of cost of operation and cost of monitoring and support. Additionally, the security aspects of a cache should be considered in the solution design.</p>
